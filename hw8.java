//Create a super class called Animal where its constructor takes in parameters weight and age
//Then, create three void methods eat(), sleep(), walk() that print "Sleeping..." so on and so on 
//Also create two void method growUp() and gainWeight(int num) that increments age by 1 and weight by num

//Create 3 subclasses Cow, Chicken, and Pig where their constructors have parameters age, weight, and name
//Create a void method eat() for each of these classes that prints "Eating {food}..." where cows eat hay, chickens eat seeds and pigs eat carrots
//Create two void methods growUp() and gainWeight(int num) that serves the same function as the same methods found in the Animal class for each of these classes

//Create 2 classes Rooster and Hen which are subclasses of the Chicken class where their constructors take in the same variables as their super class
//Create a void method crow() for the Rooster class that prints "Crowing..." and a layEgg() that prints "Laying egg..."
